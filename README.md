# 👋 Hi, I’m Guilherme Santiago

17-year-old student focused on **cybersecurity** and the intersection between **technology, law, and real-world responsibility**.

I’m interested in how technical systems, when poorly designed or misunderstood, translate into **legal risk, operational failure, and accountability** — especially in environments dealing with sensitive data, confidentiality, and compliance.

---

## 🧠 Background

My journey started in **IT support at a corporate law firm**, where I spent 8 months working with:

- Infrastructure and internal systems  
- User support in a regulated, high-responsibility environment  
- Technical issues directly tied to **legal exposure and operational impact**

That experience shaped how I see technology: not just as code, but as **decisions with consequences**.

I later completed a **one-semester academic exchange at CATS Academy Boston**, where I:
- Took **AP Computer Science (Java)**
- Strengthened my foundations in programming and problem-solving
- Achieved full English immersion through academic and daily use

## 🎯 Current Focus

Today, my technical focus is on:

- 🐧 **Linux** as my primary environment  
- 🐍 **Python** for automation, scripting, and security tooling  
- 🔐 **Cybersecurity fundamentals**, with emphasis on:
  - systems and operating environments  
  - networks and risk  
  - evidence, traceability, and responsibility  

Alongside this, I’m beginning my journey into **systems programming** with:
- **C** and **Rust**, to better understand low-level concepts  
- Secure software design  
- How system architecture influences both **security** and **legal accountability**

---

## ⚖️ Interests

I’m particularly interested in:

- **LegalTech**
- **Data protection and compliance**
- **Ethical cybersecurity**

Especially in contexts where **technical execution must align with regulation, governance, and real-world consequences**.

My long-term goal is to grow into a professional who can **bridge technology and law**, helping organizations design, secure, and operate systems with clarity, responsibility, and integrity.
