# 👋 Hey, I’m Guilherme Santiago

I’m interested in the space where **technology, law, and cybersecurity collide**.

Not just how systems are built, but how they fail, how evidence is produced, and who becomes accountable when things go wrong.

---

## ⚖️ What I Care About

- **LegalTech** and technology in regulated environments  
- **Cybersecurity** as risk, not just defense  
- **Data protection, traceability, and evidence**
- Systems that need to survive audits, disputes, and real-world consequences
- Technical decisions that become legal decisions later

---

## 🧠 How I Think About Tech

I’m drawn to systems where:
- logs matter  
- data integrity matters  
- access control matters  
- assumptions get challenged  

I like understanding **how architecture influences responsibility**:
what can be proven, what can’t, and why that matters legally.

## 🔧 What I Work With

- **Linux** as my primary environment  
- **Python** for automation, tooling, and analysis  
- **C & Rust** to understand systems at a lower level  
- Systems, networks, and operational risk  
- Evidence, traceability, and accountability by design
